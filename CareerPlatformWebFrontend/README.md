# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- Lightweight: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- Modern UI: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- Fast: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- Simple: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started (local Node)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Run with Docker Compose (recommended for full stack)

The repo root includes a `docker-compose.yml` that runs:
- RoleMappingService (Node) on 4000
- Backend (FastAPI) on 3001
- This frontend (React) on 3000

Steps:
1. From the repo root, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust variables:
   - `FRONTEND_API_URL` — base URL to the backend API (default: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`)
2. Start services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d mapping backend frontend
   ```
3. Open the app at http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- The compose file passes `REACT_APP_API_URL=${FRONTEND_API_URL}` so the frontend will call the backend correctly from the browser.
- The backend depends on the Node mapping service for role adjacency features.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
